# Project Overview 
** My project is a website design in the works using climate date to show the relationship with climate change **
** I have created a main webpage and a secondary webpage as well, on the first webpage i included a picture of the U.S map and some basic headings **
** On my second webpage I have created a table showing the change in temperature from the past 30 years in incraments of 10 **
## Research Summary
** https://corporate.exxonmobil.com/sustainability-and-reports/advancing-climate-solutions?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=1ECX_GAD_TRAF_OT_Non-Brand_ACS&utm_content=OT_Non-Brand_ACS&utm_term=climate+change&gad_source=1&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIiY-hi9eVhAMViWRHAR1wJwaHEAAYASAAEgJpMPD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds
This website is about global warming through exon and is a simple website. It uses a main which is the body of the whole website and includes the most information. It uses a frame which allows the website to use another html inside of the html already created. It has a hidden style within the code and I think it hides a style that was used. **

This website has a simpler design than the last website I chose. I noticed they used a wait feature to show the main ideas to transition in as you scroll down the website. The website uses java scrip crossorgin which allows it to reference other websites and send the user there. It uses the button in the code which we learn about in class. **
** https://impactlab.org/map/#usmeas=change-from-hist&usyear=2020-2039&gmeas=absolute&gyear=1986-2005&tab=united-states&usrcp=rcp45&usvar=mortality&usprob=0.5
For this website that shows a map about climate change and how to progress in the past or future I inspected the website and noticed the following. It has #usmeas which means it anchor for the US map that I selected in the top bar. <div class="map-tooltip" style="opacity: 0; left: 829px; top: 406px; transform: translate(-52.8563px, -70.025px);"><h5>Maine</h5><p>-5% of GDP</p></div>, this was used to pinpoint the location on the map using the latitude and longitude like you showed us in class, I could apply this to my website as well. This was followed by <h5 Georgia h5> which displayed the state using the same coordinates and I could implement this as well. This website is going to be very useful in see how I want to structure my website. **
** https://github.com/hoangsonww/WeatherMate-App
The repository shows a weather app like the one I am constructing in this project. The repository showed the use of bootstrap and Font Awesome to make the html code inside the readme. It shows the usage of the website, and all its functions to make the website work and all its features. GitHub goes into detail about the creation and showed me how to structure a readme. **
** https://github.com/abdullahwaseem01/WeatherSimple
The website is a simple weather data style shown in the repository. It links all the cases it uses and the code and the references it uses. I will use some of the things I learned from the repository. It references where it got the data from. I will use the website references of the design styles and hard code of this project. **
## Future Enhancements
** I want to work on my main page to make it more user friendly as well as more pleasing to the eye,I also want to work oncreating a search where people can searcha city and see the effects of climate page on my secondry page **

## Reflection on Resources
** I used mostly every lecture video that was posted, i used the code for creating the button, the image being put on the homescreen, and little details thrughout the videos **
** I did not use AI for any part on this project **
